WatchBoard-Prototype
====================

A GUI interface for iOS devices that looks and feels like WatchOS.

History
-------

On October 22nd, @MichaelSteeber wrote an [article] for @9to5mac in which he theorized an Apple Watch-like home screen for the iPhone. I thought the designs shown looked pretty, and the GIF he posted showing interaction with the real Apple Watch home screen made me notice a lot of tiny little details on it, so I decided to give a try at programming it over the past couple of days in my free time. This is the result. I hope you guys like it!
