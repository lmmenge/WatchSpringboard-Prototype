# WatchSpringboard-Prototype

On October 22nd, @MichaelSteeber wrote an article for [@9to5mac](http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/22/apple-watch-home-screen-design-iphone/ ) in which he theorized an Apple Watch-like home screen for the iPhone. I thought the designs shown looked pretty, and the GIF he posted showing interaction with the real Apple Watch home screen made me notice a lot of tiny little details on it, so I decided to give a try at programming it over the past couple of days in my free time. This is the result. I hope you guys like it!

This is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UggYGThmFEo&list=UU7C761Fn9aih_W6kMvkm24w) for this prototype

You'll need some tools first. Xcode 8.0 is required, as well as the command-line tools (you probably already have these installed). After installing Xcode, run the following command:
